    "## Step Zero: The Overall Idea\n",
    "One of the issues in creating an \"everything for everybody\" style biochemical ODE solver is that many of the models that people will use on it have an optimal solver method, but that's difficult to intuit just from some of the parameters of the model. There are some rules of thumb when dealing with large, slow-moving populations and fast-reacting small populations but everything after that is kind of a mixed bag of uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like a traditional ML classification/logistic regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concerns when we take this tact:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We need a large dataset of varying models, and will probably have to clean and aggregate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We will have to pickle and create a persistent object that represents our classifier, which means introducing even further dependancies to the project. (pickle is core, I'm talking about TF)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Whenever a new solver is written it has to be integrated into our classification script and rerun. This integration could have some issues with institutional memory and turover.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Will have to determine representation of models while limiting dimensionality/normalization. [Population vice rate kinetics would be my primary concern]\n",
    "\n",
    "This comes with some benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Opportunity to create something that people would find useful. (The Dream)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Practical Use of an ML Model. (Academic Gravitas)\n",
